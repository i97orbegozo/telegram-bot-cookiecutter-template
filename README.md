If you want to upload your project to Github, please make sure the URL is the same as the one you configured during project creation to ensure everything works properly (links, etc.).

## Configuration

The template provides sensible defaults for all the configuration options, however you can customize your project using the following parameters:

* `author`: The name of the person or team behind this project.
* `author_email`: The email of the author. In the case of a team or group, you can use a mailing list address.
* `project_name`: The name of the project. Prefer short names (ideally one word) using [kebab-case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Special_case_styles) (hyphen-separated lowercase letters)
* `project_slug`: The name of the project in [snake case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case)  (underscore-separated lowercase letters). Will be autogenerated if left empty.
* `project_short_description`: A short description of the project
* `project_url`: The Github URL of the project. It's recommended that you create the project first on Github and paste the generated URL here.
* `version`: The initial version ([Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)). It's recommended you use the default value (`0.1.0`).
* `python_versions`: The supported python versions. If possible, prefer supporting only the latest version available.
